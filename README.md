# Overview of Statistical Analysis 
This project is a visual pitch for a bike sharing proposal for angel investors. Using data from New York City, this proposal dives into how bike sharing is a necessary service for NYC citizens but also a business opportunity. Using data visualization this report demonstrates the trends and potential opportunities the bike sharing program can bring about. 

# Results 
It is clear from the heat map that the most popular hours of the day is between 5pm and 6pm on Mondays and Thursdays. Wednesdays are demonstrated to be the least popular days. This can be attributed to commuting hours to and from work, university, or middle/high school. The least popular hours appear to be during the day, which corresponds to the the previous observation, since most people would be at work or school.

# Summary
From the visualizations it is clear that the bike sharing program is profitable and a necessary service for a busy and commuter-heavy city such as New York. Though it appears that this services appeal more males, it can be tailored for women with necessary modifications, which can be learned through focus groups and general surveys. Also, the data lacks infomraiton such as neighborhood. It would be interesting to see if there are certain demographics tend to lean towards bike sharing programs, or if there are demographics to whom this program must be further tailored for.
